# Student-Report-Card

Using HTML and PHP and minimal CSS code I have made a program which can be used to get the students details like Name, Reg No,
Course, Course Code, Marks for 5 Subjects (CAT1, CAT2, DA1, DA2 and
QUIZ)
● Verify if the CAT marks are greater than 30 and less than zero, show an
alert message "Invalid Marks".
● If anyone of the subject mark is less than 15. Display the message via
browser as "Slow Learner and Do the Extra Assignment work".
● Calculate the Internal Marks by converting CAT 1 & 2 Marks to 15
each and Add DA1, DA2, and QUIZ marks.
● Sort and display the student details based on the Internal Mark.
● Calculate the CGPA and Display the details.
